Hello. And good day.

1) First and foremost, clone the repo
2 ) Go into install folder and pick your machine. Click the following
	- windows : install.bat
	- mac : mac_install
	- linux : linux_install
3) Done.

Troubleshoot:

If you guys have problem, check if you have python in your machine. The installation will install
python 2.7. So there might be some conflict if you have python previously. Try to uninstall and
run the installation again.
